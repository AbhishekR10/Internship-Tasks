# 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀:

In the FDI Analytics project, the analysis highlighted that the service sector, encompassing both financial and non-financial services, was the largest recipient of foreign direct investment, accounting for 17% of total FDI inflows. This strong interest in financial services can be attributed to their profit-generating potential and the ease of repatriation. Following the service sector, significant investments were observed in Computer Software and Hardware, which collectively represented 7% of the total FDI. Other sectors such as Telecommunication, Construction Development, and the Automobile industry also played a notable role, each contributing between 6% and 4% to the FDI landscape. Conversely, sectors like Coir, Defence Industries, Mathematical Instruments, and Coal Production attracted minimal investment, with each sector's share being 1% or less. This pattern, covering approximately 28 to 30 sectors, underscores areas of lower FDI interest and highlights sectors with limited foreign investment appeal.
