# Bird Strikes Analysis (2000-2011)

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of bird strikes reported between the years 2000 and 2011. The data-driven approach focuses on understanding patterns, trends, and key factors that contribute to bird strikes during this period.

## Data Sources

The dataset used in this analysis has been compiled from various aviation and wildlife databases, ensuring a robust and detailed examination of bird strike incidents. The data includes:

- **Date and Time** of each bird strike
- **Aircraft Type** and **Flight Phase** during the incident
- **Bird Species** involved
- **Location** of the strike (airport, altitude, etc.)
- **Damage** caused to the aircraft
- **Cost** implications of the strike

## Objectives

The main goals of this project are:

1. To identify patterns and trends in bird strike incidents over the 12-year period.
2. To analyze the impact of bird strikes on aviation safety and operations.
3. To provide actionable insights for reducing the risk of bird strikes in the future.

## Methodology

The analysis involves:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key trends and identifying significant factors associated with bird strikes.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to quantify the impact of various factors.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developing models to predict the likelihood of bird strikes under different conditions.

## Tools and Technologies

This project utilizes the following tools and technologies:

- **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and statistical analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For predictive modeling.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code execution and analysis.

## Results

The findings of this analysis will provide insights into:

- Seasonal and temporal patterns of bird strikes.
- The most common bird species involved in strikes.
- The phases of flight most vulnerable to bird strikes.
- Economic impacts of bird strikes on aviation.
